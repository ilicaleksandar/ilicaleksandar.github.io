1. Capacity to zoom in and out very quickly. From feature to project to strategy and the other way around
2. Doesn't shed the problems away from the team. Instead, treat them as adults and give perspective (from the business or other teams) so people can make better decisions throughout the day
3. Doesn't take all the clerical work but does it when needed, to lead by example
4. Doesn't solve problems but creates systems to solve problems instead. 🧑‍🚒 vs 👨‍🔬
5. Praise good, consistent work. Reflects on the things to improve. Sometimes, collectively as opposed to the typical "criticize in private" adagio
6. Gives actionable, candid feedback with enough details and suggestions. Grows individuals and the team too
7. Sets the bar high. There's no room for "the team doesn't want to have incident review sessions" or "one deploy a week is fine"
8. Sponsors the talent inside the team. For instance, making space for that great engineer to present in front of the CTO
9. Has a low tolerance for low-performers and (brilliant) jerks
10. Does the right thing even if the team gets upset.
