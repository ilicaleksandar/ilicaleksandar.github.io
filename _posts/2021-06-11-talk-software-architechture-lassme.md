Software Architecture is the mindset that helps you to move fast, break fewer things, and isolate the consequences of
decisions. In most successful software projects, the expert developers working on that project have a shared understanding of
the system design. Architecture is the decisions that you wish you could get right early in a project and hard to change
later.
