This is a placeholder for a diagram file. In a real scenario, you would need to create an actual PNG image file with the following diagram:

A high-level architecture diagram showing:

1. Client Layer:
   - Mobile Apps
   - Web Browsers
   - Third-party API Clients

2. API Gateway Layer:
   - Rate Limiting
   - Authentication/Authorization
   - Request Routing
   - Load Balancing

3. Microservices Layer:
   - User Service
   - Content Service
   - Social Graph Service
   - Feed Service
   - Media Service
   - Notification Service
   - Search Service
   - Analytics Service

4. Storage Layer:
   - PostgreSQL (User data)
   - MongoDB (Content)
   - Neo4j & Cassandra (Social Graph)
   - Cassandra (Feed data)
   - S3/Object Storage (Media)
   - Elasticsearch (Search)
   - Hadoop/Clickhouse (Analytics)
   - Redis (Caching)

5. Processing Layer:
   - Kafka Event Bus
   - ML Pipeline for Feed Ranking
   - Media Processing Pipeline
   - Real-time Analytics

6. Data Flow:
   - User posts content → Content Service → Kafka → Feed Processing → Feed DB
   - User requests feed → Feed Service → Ranking → Personalized feed returned

The diagram should use different colors for different service domains and show key data flows between components.
